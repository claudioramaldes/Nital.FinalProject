# Nital.FinalProject

At the moment of uploading the files I kept receiving a message from GitHub that it wasn't possible to upload all the files, and only later I realized that there was a limit 
to the number of files, and since I was wasting too much time trying to figure out what to do, and still had to prepare the presentation and record, I selected some and 
included in folders so would get the files to be uploaded on time.
Later I realized that I could compress everything, desperate I didn't think about this, so that's why there are some folders and one rar file.
